# REQ-010-github-pages-deployment.md

## User Story

As a developer, I want the static site to be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages after each successful build, so that the latest version is always available at a custom domain with SSL, and the deployment workflow remains within the GitHub ecosystem at no cost.

## Functional Requirements

- FR-010-001: Deploy static site to GitHub Pages
  - Description: The build output (from `dist/` or equivalent) must be deployed to a GitHub Pages branch (e.g., `gh-pages`) automatically after each successful build on the main branch.
  - Pre-conditions: Static site is generated in the build output directory (see REQ-006).
  - Post-conditions: The latest build is published and accessible via GitHub Pages.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
      Given a successful build on the main branch
      When the deployment workflow runs
      Then the static site is published to the GitHub Pages branch
      And the site is accessible at the configured GitHub Pages URL
    ```
  - Dependencies: REQ-006, ADR-006

- FR-010-002: Support custom domain and SSL
  - Description: The deployed site must support a custom domain and SSL via GitHub Pages configuration.
  - Pre-conditions: Custom domain is configured in the repository settings.
  - Post-conditions: The site is accessible via the custom domain with SSL enabled.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Custom domain and SSL support
      Given the custom domain is configured in GitHub Pages settings
      When the site is deployed
      Then the site is accessible via the custom domain
      And SSL is enabled via Let's Encrypt
    ```
  - Dependencies: ADR-006

- FR-010-003: Continuous deployment from repository
  - Description: Deployment to GitHub Pages must be triggered automatically on push to the main branch using GitHub Actions or equivalent CI/CD.
  - Pre-conditions: CI/CD workflow is configured in the repository.
  - Post-conditions: Every push to main triggers a build and deploys the latest site.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Continuous deployment on push
      Given a new commit is pushed to the main branch
      When the CI/CD workflow runs
      Then the site is built and deployed to GitHub Pages automatically
    ```
  - Dependencies: ADR-006

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-010-001: Deployment workflow must complete in under 10 minutes for the current site size.
- NFR-010-002: The deployment process must not expose sensitive information (e.g., secrets, tokens) in logs or public branches.
- NFR-010-003: The solution must be cost-free for public repositories.
- NFR-010-004: The deployment workflow must be maintainable and require minimal manual intervention.

## Technical Guidance

- Use GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process.
- Deploy the contents of the build output directory (e.g., `dist/`) to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Configure the repository's GitHub Pages settings to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.
- Set up a custom domain and enable SSL via GitHub Pages settings as needed.
- Reference ADR-006 for architectural decisions and rationale.
- Ensure the workflow is documented for future maintainers.
