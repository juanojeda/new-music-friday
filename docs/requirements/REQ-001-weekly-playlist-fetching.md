# REQ-001: Weekly Playlist Fetching and Static Site Generation

## User Story
As a music enthusiast, I want the app to automatically fetch and display my public YouTube Music playlists named "New Music Friday" once a week, so that I can easily browse and play the latest playlists without manual updates or excessive API usage.

## Functional Requirements

- FR-001.1: Scheduled Playlist Fetch
  - Description: The system must fetch all public YouTube Music playlists belonging to the user once per week.
  - Pre-conditions: The user has public playlists on YouTube Music.
  - Post-conditions: The latest playlists are available for display and playback on the site.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Weekly playlist fetch
      Given the user has public playlists on YouTube Music
      When the scheduled fetch runs (once per week)
      Then the system retrieves all playlists whose names start with "New Music Friday"
      And stores them for site generation
    ```
  - Dependencies: YouTube Music API access

- FR-001.2: Static Site Generation
  - Description: The system must generate a static web page listing the fetched playlists after each weekly fetch.
  - Pre-conditions: Playlists have been fetched and filtered.
  - Post-conditions: The static site is updated with the latest playlists.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Static site generation after fetch
      Given playlists have been fetched and filtered
      When the site generation process runs
      Then the static site is updated to display the latest playlists
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-001.1

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-001.1: API Usage
  - Category: Performance
  - Description: The system must minimize API calls by fetching playlists only once per week.
  - Metrics/Thresholds: No more than one fetch per week.

## Technical Specifications & Guidance
- Use a scheduled job (e.g., cron, serverless function) to trigger the weekly fetch.
- Use YouTube Music API or appropriate scraping method to retrieve playlists.
- Store playlist data in a format suitable for static site generation (e.g., JSON, Markdown).
- Trigger static site build/deploy after successful fetch.
- Ensure error handling for failed fetches (retry, alert, etc.).
