# REQ-INF-002-material-ui-theme.md

## User Story
As a developer, I want Material UI integrated and a theme configured in the React app, so that I can use accessible, consistent, and customizable UI components.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-INF-002-001: Install and configure Material UI
  - Description: The project must include Material UI (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`) as dependencies, and the app must be wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` with a default theme.
  - Pre-conditions: React app is set up at the project root.
  - Post-conditions: Material UI components can be used throughout the app, and the theme can be customized.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Material UI is integrated
      Given the React app is set up
      When I use a Material UI component (e.g., Button)
      Then it renders correctly with the default theme
      And the app is wrapped in a ThemeProvider
    ```
  - Dependencies: INF-001

- FR-INF-002-002: Provide a sample Material UI component
  - Description: The app must render at least one Material UI component (e.g., Button) to verify integration.
  - Pre-conditions: Material UI is installed and ThemeProvider is set up.
  - Post-conditions: The sample component is visible in the app.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Sample Material UI component renders
      Given the app is running
      When I view the main page
      Then I see a Material UI Button rendered with the theme
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-INF-002-001

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-INF-002-001: The app must use only Material UI components for UI (no custom or third-party UI libraries).
- NFR-INF-002-002: The theme must be customizable via the `createTheme` API.
- NFR-INF-002-003: The integration must work on macOS and Linux.

## Technical Guidance
- Install `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled` as dependencies.
- Wrap the app in a `ThemeProvider` using `createTheme`.
- Use Material UI components (e.g., Button) in the app.
- Customize the theme as needed for branding or accessibility.
