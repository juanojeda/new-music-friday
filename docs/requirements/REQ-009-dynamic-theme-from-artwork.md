# REQ-009: Dynamic Material UI Theme from Playlist Artwork

## User Story

As a user, I want the app's theme to dynamically reflect the unique artwork of each playlist, so that the UI feels personalized and visually cohesive with the selected playlist.

## Functional Requirements

- FR-009-001: Generate unique SVG artwork for each playlist using jdenticon
  - Description: When playlists are fetched, generate a unique SVG artwork for each playlist using its ID as the seed with the jdenticon library.
  - Pre-conditions: Playlist data is available with unique IDs.
  - Post-conditions: Each playlist has a corresponding SVG artwork.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Generate SVG artwork for playlist
      Given a playlist with a unique ID
      When playlists are fetched
      Then an SVG artwork is generated for each playlist using jdenticon
    ```
  - Dependencies: Playlist fetching logic

- FR-009-002: Extract dominant color from SVG artwork
  - Description: For each generated SVG, extract the dominant color using a color analysis library (e.g., color-thief, node-vibrant) by rendering the SVG to a canvas and analyzing pixel data.
  - Pre-conditions: SVG artwork is generated for each playlist.
  - Post-conditions: Each playlist has a dominant color value stored in its data.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Extract dominant color from SVG
      Given a playlist with generated SVG artwork
      When the SVG is rendered to a canvas
      Then the dominant color is extracted and stored with the playlist data
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-009-001

- FR-009-003: Generate Material UI theme palette from dominant color
  - Description: Use the extracted dominant color as the seed to generate a Material UI theme palette, either via a utility library (e.g., material-you-color) or custom logic, and store the palette for each playlist.
  - Pre-conditions: Dominant color is available for each playlist.
  - Post-conditions: Each playlist has an associated theme palette.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Generate theme palette from dominant color
      Given a playlist with a dominant color
      When a theme palette is generated
      Then the palette is stored and ready for use with Material UI
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-009-002

- FR-009-004: Dynamically update app theme on playlist selection
  - Description: When a user selects a playlist, update the Material UI theme in the app to use the selected playlist's palette, applying it via ThemeProvider.
  - Pre-conditions: Theme palettes are available for all playlists.
  - Post-conditions: The app's theme updates to match the selected playlist.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Dynamic theme update on playlist selection
      Given multiple playlists with theme palettes
      When a user selects a playlist
      Then the app's theme updates to use the selected playlist's palette
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-009-003

- FR-009-005: Smoothly transition between themes
  - Description: Implement smooth visual transitions (e.g., using CSS transitions or framer-motion) when switching between themes to enhance user experience.
  - Pre-conditions: The app theme updates on playlist selection.
  - Post-conditions: Theme changes are visually smooth and not abrupt.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    ```Gherkin
    Scenario: Smooth theme transition
      Given the app theme changes on playlist selection
      When a new playlist is selected
      Then the theme transition is visually smooth
    ```
  - Dependencies: FR-009-004

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-009-001: All UI must use Material UI components and theming.
- NFR-009-002: Theme transitions must complete in under 500ms.
- NFR-009-003: The solution must work on modern browsers (latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Technical Specifications & Guidance

- Use jdenticon to generate SVGs for playlist artwork.
- Render SVGs to a canvas and use a color extraction library (e.g., color-thief, node-vibrant) to determine the dominant color.
- Use a palette generation utility (e.g., material-you-color) to create a Material UI theme palette from the dominant color.
- Store the palette with each playlist's data for quick access.
- Update the Material UI theme via ThemeProvider when a playlist is selected.
- Use CSS transitions or framer-motion for smooth theme changes.
- Ensure all UI components use Material UI and respect the current theme.
