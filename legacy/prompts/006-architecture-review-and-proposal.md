As the software engineer, review the architecture of this project, and propose a structure that will be:
- simple to maintain
- easy to understand
- idiomatic for typescript

One of the problems I am seeing in the current application is that UI components are flakey, hard to test, and hard to maintain.

I also see that the application setup is not a standard setup so debugging issues is not so straightforward.

Identify the tech stack, and how it could be improved to achieve the project's stated aims.

Create an ADR to document the proposed architecture and tech stack.
