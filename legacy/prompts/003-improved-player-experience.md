## Improved player experience

Because the playlist is an audio only playlist, I don't want the player to show like a video player. Instead I want it to look more like an audio player.
- it should have media controls:
  - play / pause
  - next / prev
  - track head control
- It should NOT show
  - the "video" portion of the embed (as it's audio only)
