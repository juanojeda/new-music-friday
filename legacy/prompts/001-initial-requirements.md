## NEW MUSIC FRIDAY

I want you to build me an app that:

### playlist fetching and site generation

- once a week the app will:
  - look up my youtube music playlists
  - filters to just the ones whose name start with "New Music Friday"
  - builds a web page that lists those playlists
    The reason it's running only once a week is that the playlists are only released on Friday, and from then on won't change. I also want to make sure that API calls stay low.

### playlist display

- sorts them by most recently created at the top

### Playlist playing

- anybody that accesses the page can play a playlist
- As they are public playlists, no login is required for this
