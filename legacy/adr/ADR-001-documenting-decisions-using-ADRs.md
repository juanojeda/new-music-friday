# 001 - Documenting Decisions Using ADRs

## Status
Accepted

## Date Log
2024-07-23 - Accepted (initial adoption)

## Context & Problem Statement
As the project evolves, architectural and significant technical decisions need to be recorded in a consistent, discoverable, and structured way. Without a clear process, decisions may be lost, misunderstood, or repeated, leading to confusion and technical debt.

## Considered Options
1. Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
2. Use ad-hoc documentation (e.g., wiki pages, comments, or meeting notes)
3. Do not formally document decisions

## Decision
Chosen option: "Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)", because ADRs provide a lightweight, standardized, and version-controlled approach to documenting important decisions, their context, and consequences. This improves transparency, onboarding, and long-term maintainability.

## Consequences
- Good, because decisions are easy to find, review, and update as the project evolves
- Good, because ADRs encourage thoughtful, explicit decision-making
- Bad, because it introduces a small process overhead for writing and maintaining ADRs

## Details

### Considered options

#### Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Each significant architectural or technical decision is documented in a markdown file following a standard template
- ADRs are stored in the `docs/adr/` directory and versioned with the codebase
- Each ADR is assigned a unique number and descriptive title

#### Use ad-hoc documentation
- Decisions are recorded in various places (e.g., wiki, comments, meeting notes)
- Lacks consistency, discoverability, and version control

#### Do not formally document decisions
- Decisions are made and communicated informally
- High risk of knowledge loss, misunderstandings, and repeated mistakes
