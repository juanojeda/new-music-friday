## Deployment & GitHub Pages

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

- On every push to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow builds the site and deploys the contents of the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
- GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch in repository settings.
- No manual deployment steps are required for standard updatesâ€”just push to `main`.
- For details on the deployment workflow, see [REQ-010-github-pages-deployment.md](docs/requirements/REQ-010-github-pages-deployment.md).
