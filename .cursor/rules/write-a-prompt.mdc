When the user triggers this rule, the user intends to save the following in a prompts file.
The AI should save the file in the 'prompts' folder using sequential numbering with a descriptive slug.

Once the AI verifies that the prompt exists in the prompts folder, it should then execute the prompt.

for example, if the user types:
```
This is the prompt I want to save
```

then the AI should save a new file in the prompts folder.

## FILE CONTENTS
This is the prompt I want to save

## FILE FORMAT
The file should be a markdown file

## FILE SEQUENTIAL NUMBERING
The file should be sequentially numbered according to the other files in the prompts folder. For instance if the prompts folder has the following files:
```
...
- 0021-feeding-the-cats.md
- 0022-feeding-the-dogs.md
- 0023-feeding-the-cats-part-2.md
```
The new prompt file should be numbered `0024-[the-file-name].md`

## FILE NAME
The file should be named according to:
- the content and context of the prompt, with a descriptive but concise slug. In the above example, it might be `0024-prompt-to-save.md`

## PROMPT EXECUTION
- Before executing the prompt, the AI should validate that the prompt exists in the prompts folder
- If the prompt specifies a cursor-rule to follow (for instance "as the planner" or "as the software-engineer" or something to that effect), the AI should execute following that cursor-rule in context.
- If there is no cursor-rule or role specified, the AI should announce which role it believes is best, then proceed with execution.
