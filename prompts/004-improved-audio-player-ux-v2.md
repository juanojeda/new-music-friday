## Improved audio player UX v2

- I want to only show a single, unified audio player
- When the user selects a playlist, the audio controls should function for that playlist
- When the user selects a playlist from the list of playlists, the audio player should display that it is playing from that playlist
- The audio player should show the name of the track that is currently playing
