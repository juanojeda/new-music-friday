I want to add keyboard controls to the player that match the user expectations.

When the player is visible and enabled
- I want to be able to use keyboard media controls (eg. Play, Pause etc)
- I want spacebar to toggle the play or pause functionality.
- These controls should be enabled regardless of whether the player is focused/tabbed to.
